          <h2>The Halloween Party</h2>
          <h3><em>The Halloween party was going great. The vibes were alive,
            and the crowd ignited and immersed themselves in the dancing
            and music. Until...</em></h3>

          <div class="article-text halloween">
            <p>What was that? A man in a ghost costume stumbled from
              the crowd into the garden, staggering. He clutched at his
              chest, bent over, and let out a horrible cough. Blood flew
              from his mouth, dribbling over his sickeningly white costume.
              Within seconds, the strong trickle became a spray. People around
              the man tried in desperation to help him, but had no idea
              what to do. After a few agonizing moments, he collapsed.</p>
            <p>"Where are the medics?" a voice yelled over the din. Some of the
              partygoers who had been there longer looked at each other, and it
              quickly became apparent that there were no medics.</p>
            <p>"That man is dying!" "What can we do?" "What's happening?"</p>
            <p>The crowd looked to their neighbors in horror and confusion.
              A woman screamed, then two, then five - even those who had never
              met the man who had just collapsed looked on in horror at his
              condition. The music was drowned out by the cacophony of the
              people, all of whom now seemed to be screaming at the top of
              their lungs - unsure of what was happening.</p>
            <p>A man who had been in the crowd took a huge step into the
              center, as if fighting against the tide of the crowd. He stood
              tall, commanding the attention of the assembled partygoers.
              Silence descended.</p>

            <p>"I'm not the only one who can do this" he said, solemnly.
                "There are many people like me here... lets work together."</p>
            <p>A definite focused rash of nods and agreements bounced around
              the crowd.</p>
            <p>"Any of you who are... uh, like us - can you hear me?"</p>
            <p>Almost every head nodded.</p>
            <p>"Okay. Everyone who is able, we need you to go check on the
              people close to you. If they are okay, move on to the next.
              If anyone needs help, tell them to stay right where they are and
              not move. We need to make sure the garden and the house here are
              safe.</p>
            <p>"The rest of you who aren't in costume - we need you to join
              the people who are searching. Help them look for anyone who
              needs help.</p>
            <p>"We should keep the crowd together; when you find someone,
              come back and tell them to wait for the medics. Get them to sit
              down."</p>
            <p>The group nodded collectively.</p>
            <p>"Please be safe," the man said, "but do as much good
              as you can."</p>
            <p>Around him, the crowd was already working together. As he set
              off back to help, he felt a warmth spread through his chest. He
              looked around and realized he wasn't the only one glowing. The
              people around him were, too. Bright, beautiful lights. He'd
              never seen them before... but he knew what they meant.
              He knew.</p>
            <p>They were going to save lives. And that... was all that
              mattered.</p>
