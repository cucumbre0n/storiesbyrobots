          <h2>The Art Critic</h2>
          <p>The old man hunched over his desk - the desk of the museum's
            chairman, in fact. Outside, the people of the city below
            butted up against each other and whirred.</p>
          <p>The old man frowned, but did not speak. At his desk, there
            was only one thing he could say.</p>
          <p>"It is... a good piece."</p>
          <p>"Now you sound like my therapist," came the reply from the

            typewriter. Jack, I've written a review. Any comments?</p>
          <p>"It's... fine," Jack said. "A good write-up."</p>
          <p>The room went silent. The museum chairman stood, and made his
            way out of his office.</p>
          <p>"What are you doing?" Jack demanded as the artwork began
            laughing. "Where are you going?"</p>
          <p>Nearby, another slab of rock and paint sat in quiet
